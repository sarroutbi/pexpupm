The proposal of this exercise is to implement the "Klondike" game. This card game is also known as solitaire. 

A complete description of the game can be observed in: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_%28solitaire%29

- There are some limitations that must be considered for the game:
  * The game will work based on text options (New game, Move, etc.)
  * The game will only work on a Deal Mode

However, it should be possible to change, easily, the code, taking into account next future change motivations:
  * It should not be very difficult to change the game to have graphical interface
  * Deal mode could be selectable by the user at any moment of the game
  * The kind of movements should be easily changed
  * The number of Tableaus should be changeable to a different number easily
  * Deck should be easily changeable (from French to Spanish). In case Spanish deck is used, tableau will accept card that are of different suite (vs black red of French deck)
